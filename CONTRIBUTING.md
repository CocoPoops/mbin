# /kbin Contributor Guide

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is sometimes a good practice to search for existing [issues](https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/issues) that might help you.

If you still feel the need for asking a question, we recommend [joining our community on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/%23kbin-space:matrix.org) where you can ask your questions to our community members.
